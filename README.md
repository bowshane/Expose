* Expose

*Expose* is a developer tool used to view files and
 various system information. It is based on the original *Norton
 Utilities* from way back, and more recently on *Gander*
 which were both execelent tools that I really miss. So, I "rolled
 my own" and this is it.

Since the program uses a *Window's Explorer* type interface,
 I chose to name the program <B>*Expose*</B>. I toyed with the
 idea of *Exploder*, but it reminded me of Blake's truck. I
 dunno, I'm open to a new name!

Essentially, you just navigate through the file system using the
 tree on the left side of the screen. The right side displays the
 binary contents of the file on top, and if possible a friendly
 rendering on the bottom. Of course the split panes are resizable.

I intend to add a grep/sed type feature for directories, but you'll
 have to wait for the next version! It's really frustrating me that the
 drag and drop is not working. It's disbled right now until I can read up
 a little more on *file flavors*. (Sounds tasty, but it's very bland
 stuff.) I also want to add some right
 click functionality to the file tree.

Oh, I have been able to crash the program when loading extremely
 large *CSV* files: Maybe I'm not catching an out of memory fault??
 I will work on that for the next version as well.

Hope it's somewhat useful to ya "as is." If nothing else, it's a
 pretty good picture viewer, a la the original *ACDC* for those
 who remember that app (not the band). The *Shrink to fit* and
 *Stretch to fit* checkboxes are really handy: Note that they
 both maintain the aspect ratio.
